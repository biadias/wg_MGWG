### Internal vs. external stock recruitment

(N Cadigan)

There has been a proliferation of published analyses on stock productivity based on model-estimated time-series of parental stock size and recruitment (e.g. RAM database pubs). However, WGMG in 2013 recommended:

"There is a need to compare internal (i.e. within assessment model) vs. external estimation of stock-recruit parameters. Where possible, estimation should be carried out internally to take proper account of covariance structures, provided there is no evidence of model misspecification in such a process. Model diagnostics should always be carefully explored in such circumstances."

External estimation is affected by covariate measurement error bias, which could include overestimation of the slope-at-the-origin and underestimation of Rmax. This could be bad for sustainable management.

Additional perspective on modelling assessment model outputs is given by Brooks and Deroba (2015) and Conn et al. (2010)

The objectives of this research are: 1) Determine when parameters of stock recruit relationships can be estimated internally to a stock assessment model (e.g., Conn et al., 2010), 2) Determine when parameters of stock recruit relationships can be estimated using estimates of parental stock size and recruitment from a stock assessment, but with the relationship estimated external to the stock assessment.  Ultimately, is it better to use internal or external estimation?

## Proposal Format

* Working title:  Internal versus external estimation of stock-recruit relationships: can we and should we?
* Participants
  * See below
* Background
  * Brief literature review: [Brooks and Deroba 2015](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0231) [Conn et al. 2010 CJFAS](https://doi.org/10.1139/F09-194)
* Objectives - See above
  * For Internal Estimation
    * Can correct S-R be identified? (AIC for model selection?) see [Conn et al. 2010 CJFAS](https://doi.org/10.1139/F09-194)
    * How precise are S-R parameters?
    * Should we also try a 3-parameter S-R?
    * How precisely are reference points estimated?
 * For External Estimation 
    * Can correct S-R be identified? (AIC for model selection?)
    * How precise are S-R parameters?
    * Should we also try a 3-parameter S-R?
    * How precisely are reference points estimated?
    * Is this approach improved if you also use the Hessian (from the fitted model)?
* Plan
  * Methods, data
    * Assessment model types
      * SCAA (SR internal, sigma_R known)
      * State-space (SR internal, process error in recruitment only)
      * State-space (SR internal, process error in survival)
      * Other state-space
    * Use state-space model to simulate population with process errors
    * SUGGESTION: CONSIDER USING A COMMON OPERATING MODEL WITH OTHER PROJECTS
      * Stock-recruit types
        * Beverton-Holt
        * Ricker
        * Hockey (not differentiable)
        * Mean recruitment
      * Number of years
        * 25
        * 50
      * variance of log-recruitment
        * 0.4
        * 0.8 
        * random walk
      * Contrast in population/SSB
        * Low F: runif(0.2*Fmsy, 0.4*Fmsy)
        * High F: runif(1.2*Fmsy, 1.4*Fmsy)
        * rollercoaster F
