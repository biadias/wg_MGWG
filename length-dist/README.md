## Background

[Area of research]
Extending diagnostics for stock health.

[Brief literature review]


[Remaining questions]

[Why is this important]
Policy demands EU side
 Maritime Strategy Framework Directive
 Common Fisheries Policy
Length based reference points are often preferred in data poor situations.
The aim is to extend the ecological theory of trunctated size structure to diagnostics for stock status. The LD based reference points/diagnostics are expected to complement exisiting reference points/diagnostics to capture length structure such as large fish, mega-spawners etc
Avoidance of loss of yield due to fishing trunkated stocks.


## Objective
definition of healthy length distribution
reference points that can be applied

## Plan
Perspective paper
  What is a healthy length distribution?
       Model output LD (length distribution):
            Tracking LDs of several stocks from around the globe:
                        Pac Halibut, NEA Cod, George's Bank haddock
                        NWWG, AFWG, Northern Hake, Southern Hake,
                        Tuna, WGNSSK, Orange Roughy 
                        (all pending data availability)


  Simulate/Demonstrate the problem of Ref points.
      2 stocks same Bmsy and Fmsy but different LD. I.E. different selectivity, introduce nat mort events. Check if one is more resilient/resistent.


                
Diagnostic Development
  Depending on Perspective paper's results
  Can we use input data rather than model output

  Quantiles, Number of MegaSpawner, proportion above a given length                    maturity at length/ fecundity at length ~ absolute numbers/relative            ranges of length/ quantile.
  Virgin/Equilibrium vs current status
  B@length vs N@length

Reference Points
  Global-, species-, stock-, sub-stock-specific?
            
Future issues
  length distrbutions ~ measure of health
  the role of growth (model) 
  Maturity, fecundity
  Speak to Fisheries Induced Evolution people?
  age vs length

* Data
  LD of many Stocks, preferably with crash/rebuild dynamics and long time series
