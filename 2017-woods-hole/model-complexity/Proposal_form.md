### Coordinators

Task-master: Helen
Simulation (age-based): Liz? ...?
Simulation (length-based): Dan?  


### Background

More complex models are coming into practice, and additional complexity is often suggested by some while others advocate 
for keeping things simple.  What is the appropriate level of complexity for a given set of data?  
We intend to simulate 2 case studies of “data rich” stocks and compare whether there are telltale diagnostics 
that enable the user to determine if their model requires additional complexity.  Furthermore, we want to evaluate whether 
information criteria (such as AIC and predictive cross validation) are reliable tools for model selection.
  
- how to explain the complex models to the public (words and pictures)

- if you have length and age, use one or both? pros/cons?

### Area of research

This group proposes to perform a simulation and evaluate diagnostics to address the question. 
Diagnostics to consider include residuals, whether there is support for model assumptions, parameter identifiability, ...

### Brief literature review

## Remaining questions

### Why is this important

### Objectives

### Plan

Simulate data corresponding to the profiles described below

Fit suite of stock assessment models 

Test performance of complex vs. simple configurations

Develop general advice 


### Methods, data

We propose two/three case studies:

1. Typical groundfish: possibly cod-like
- \~25 year life span (M\~0.2)
- Growth: protracted
- Maturity: protracted
2. Typical pelagic: herring-like (other options: anchovy?) 
- Life span <15? (M ~ 0.55) [anchovy: <5 years, with M ~ 0.8-0.9]
- Growth: more rapid   [anchovy: growth curve is shows ~ sine curve VonBert]
- Maturation: more rapid [fully mature at age 0.5-1.0]
3. An Invertebrate: Surfclam 
- 35 year life span (M~0.15)
- Growth - K/M faster than for fish
- Maturation - fully mature by 1 year 

Considerations for the simulated data
-------------------------------------
- do we want to include something with CPUE (change in q? missing catch?)

- selectivity changes
- M changes (pattern at age, or time, or both?)


-------------------------------------
### Tasks, who's doing what

The suite of data rich models to be applied, and working group members able to run them:

VPA -Liz, Helen?

SCAA (ASAP? a4a) -Liz, Helen? Ernesto

SS (SAM?) - Geir

CASA/SAMS -Dvora

CASAL - (Craig in group 1)

Gadget - (Arni Magnusson)

SS-(Dan)

---------
Alejandro - literature review, plots for fittings...

Helen - literature review, task-matering, milestone monitoring, model fitting (?); consider what to explore on data-poor end

Liz - simulating and model fitting, co-coordinate

Geir - fitting SAM; literature review

Knut - literature review, XSAM (deterministic survival, reading in variance from something) ?

Dvora - fit length based models; also fit simple length based models; literature review; consider what to explore on data poor

Dan - simulating and model fitting

Ernesto - model fitting
