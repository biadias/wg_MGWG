## 29-Oct-2018

Call participants: Liz Brooks, Dan Hennen, Alejandro Yanez, Dvora Hart

For simulated data:
  - clarify timing of M change versus timing of selectivity change (should not be in same year)
  - agree to timing for outputting the data (Jan-1 or Dec-31); make sure this works with the S-R timing
  - need short description of the parameterization and assumptions for Gadget data simulation (we couldn't find this in the manual on the Gadget wiki)
  - can observation error be generated by Gadget?
  
  
Tasks:
  - Alejandro: come up with cool name for his age-based model
  - Everyone: literatuer search
  - Dvora: to check that simulated length/age output is in a format she can use
  
  
Next call:
  - Early December would be a good target
  - Wait to receive simulated data before scheduling next call so we can follow-up with questions about output
  - Will send a final email to WGMG folks who did not respond to previous email about their continued participation in this subgroup
