ICES and Stock Assessment Methods: Overview and Current Research

Arni Magnusson, Chair of the ICES Methods Working Group

This presentation gives an overview of three topics. (1) ICES, an organization
that facilitates international collaboration in marine science, a network of
more than 5000 scientists from over 700 marine institutes in our 20 member
countries, including US and Canada. (2) The ICES Methods Working Group, an open
group of stock assessment scientists that work together on projects that are
oriented to fit in the format of multi-authored journal papers. (3) TAF, a new
online system and workflow that makes all ICES stock assessments open and
reproducible science.
