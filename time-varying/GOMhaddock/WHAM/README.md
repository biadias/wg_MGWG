### WHAM model fit details

Using age-specific selectivity for surveys or fishery catch facilitated convergence for one or more models.
All models use the same selectivity assumptions for consistency.
Trial fits with all age-specific selectivities free, led to assumed ages for peak selectivity.
Age for peak selectivity in index 1 was 3,8.
Age for peak selectivity in index 2 was 3,8.

Model 4 is used to provide results for comparison with other model frameworks.
